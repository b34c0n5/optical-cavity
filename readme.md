# optical cavity simulator

The goal of this project was constructing an optical cavity simulator to be used as a
didactic tool to train IT security engineers in the fundamentals of quantum cryptography, which
uses probabilistic processes, not the more familiar deterministic ones. Optical cavities play an
essential part in several promising approaches to creating single-photon sources, an important
step towards implementing quantum cryptography protocols, such as BB84, and a possible element for creating quantum computers and thus executing quantum cryptology algorithms such as Shorâ€™s.
